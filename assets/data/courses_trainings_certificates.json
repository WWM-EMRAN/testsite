You’ll learn how to handle missing data, manage non‑numeric/categorical features, prevent data leakage, and properly use pipelines to streamline your preprocessing and modeling workflow. The course also covers robust model validation using cross‑validation, and explores powerful algorithms like gradient boosting (XGBoost) to build accurate models for structured data. With a mix of interactive tutorials and practical exercises, the course prepares you to build reliable, production‑quality machine learning models from raw, imperfect data.",

It has been developed over the last 30 years by an amazing team, including Nick Parlante, Eric Roberts and more. The course teaches the fundamentals of computer programming using the widely-used Python programming language. This course is for everyone from humanists, and social scientists, to hardcore engineers. What makes Code in Place special? We recruit and train one volunteer teacher for every 10 students in order to create a vibrant community of teaching and learning. We believe that the magnitude of people who want to teach computer science is large and may be roughly proportional to the magnitude of people who want to learn. Why? Teaching is joyful and teaching is the best way to learn both content and team-leading skills. We do hope this course inspires more human-centred learning for all.",
